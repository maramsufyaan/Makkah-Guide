            Umrah is a set of rituals of worshipping Allah by entering into the state of Ihram, performing circumambulation of the Kaaba, performing Sa’i between Safa and Marwa, and having one's hair shaven or trimmed.

             <strong>  It has great stature and virtues, including :</strong> 
           
           <br>
       <ul class="kexixH">
         <li>
             <strong> Allah mentioned it along with Hajj</strong> and commanded that it be completed and performed in the most perfect manner, for the sake of Allah’s pleasure. The Almighty said: {and perform properly the Hajj and Umrah for Allah}.
           
           </li>
           
         <li>
           <strong> It wipes out sins and reduces poverty and need: </strong> the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) said: "Perform Hajj and Umrah consecutively; for they remove poverty and sin as the bellows remove impurity from iron".
           
           </li>
           
           <li>
           <strong>Umrah expiates sins: </strong> the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) said: "From one Umrah to the next is an expiation for the sins committed between them".
           
           </li>
           
           <li>
           <strong>  Every step in circumambulation is an increase in good deeds and forgiveness of sins:</strong> the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) said about the virtues of circumambulating the honored House: "Whoever circumambulates the House does not raise a foot or put down the other, except that Allah will write down for him a good deed, erase for him a sin and raise his rank".
           </li>
         <li>
           
           <strong> Sa’i between Safa and Marwa is a reason why Allah will be thankful and rewarding to His servant:</strong> after mentioning Sa’i between Safa and Marwa, Allah informed us that He fully knows His servant’s work and that He will reward the servant for the deed and good work. He said: "And who volunteers good, Allah is All-grateful, All-knowing".
           
           </li>
         </ul>
       <strong>  Umrah in Ramadan</strong>
           <p> Umrah has great virtues at all times. It is one of the deeds that expiate sins, for the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) said. Additionally, it has a special virtue during Ramadan.</p>
           
         <strong>  The reward for performing Umrah in Ramadan :</strong>

           <li>
               The Prophet blessings and peace be upon him said: "Performance of Umrah in Ramadan is equivalent to Hajj", or he said: "Equal to performance of Hajj with me"

            <strong>Ihram is a great worship with which you start your Umrah rituals</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p1>
              
            In Ihram, all people are equal in their dress and appearance. Color and material possessions do not matter at all. After entering the state of Ihram, they proceed to perform the rituals in humility to Allah and supplicating Him alone.

Ihram is the commencement of the rituals of Hajj or Umrah. The rituals are commenced by intending to start Umrah or Hajj and reciting Talbiyah. It is the first pillar of Hajj and Umrah.

A Hajj or Umrah pilgrim may stipulate upon initiating Ihram if he fears his inability to complete his rituals for any reason.

Ihram is the first step in your journey of faith and an act of the heart with which you engage in a great act of worship. Allah commanded us to make our intentions sincere and to perform the rituals for His sake, Glory be to Him, in the most perfect manner. The Almighty said: {Perform Hajj and Umrah for (the sake of) Allah}.
              </p1>
       <br>
        
        <p>
            <strong>What is Ihram?</strong>

          <ul class="kexixH">
            <li>
                 Ihram is entering into the act of worship of Hajj or Umrah. It involves intending to enter into Umrah or Hajj and reciting Talbiyah, which is the first of the pillars of Hajj and Umrah.
              </li>
              
            <li>
              It is the first step in your journey of faith and an act of the heart with which you engage in a great act of worship. It is a great act of worship for which Allah commanded us to make our intentions sincere, and perform its rituals for His sake, Glory be to Him, in the most perfect manner. As the Almighty said: {Perform Hajj and Umrah for (the sake of) Allah}.
              
              </li>
              
              <li>
              With this intention, things that are permissible before entering into the state of Ihram are now forbidden: such as intercourse, shaving the head, clipping nails, covering the head, wearing sewn clothes for men, etc.
              
              </li>
              
              <li>
               If you want to engage in the worship of Umrah, you must refrain from the prohibitions of Ihram, and intend to engage in Umrah saying: "Labbayka Umrah". Then, you begin reciting Talbiyah. If you intend to start performing the Hajj rituals, you shall start with by saying: "Labbayka Hajjan". Then you begin reciting Talbiyah.

              <strong> Sa’i between Safa and Marwa is a reason why Allah will be thankful and rewarding to His servant:</strong> after mentioning Sa’i between Safa and Marwa, Allah informed us that He fully knows His servant’s work and that He will reward the servant for the deed and good work. He said: "And who volunteers good, Allah is All-grateful, All-knowing".
              
              </li>
            </ul>
          <strong> Stipulate a condition in Ihram</strong>
              
              <p>  Islam is a religion of ease, as Allah Almighty said: {Allah intends for you ease and does not want to make things difficult for you}. One of the manifestations of this facilitation for Muslims in performing acts of worship is taking into account the circumstances that may prevent them from completing the rituals of Hajj or Umrah.

If a pilgrim fears that he will not be able to complete the rituals of Hajj or Umrah for any reason, it is lawful to stipulate a condition while in Ihram.</p>
             <strong> How to stipulate?</strong> 
              <p>
If the pilgrim performing Hajj or Umrah fears that he will not be able to complete his rituals due to a disease or a lawful excuse or for a reason beyond his control, it is allowed for him/her to make exceptions in their utterance of the intention. One does so by saying after saying "Labbayka Umrah" or "Labbayka Hajjan": "If I'm deterred for any reason, then my place is where You deterred me (this can be said in any language)". If a pilgrim says this and stipulates a condition, and then something prevents them from completing the ritual, it is permissible for him to leave the state of Ihram without falling under any further obligation.

              </p>
              <p>
              
              Out of respect for the Honored House of Allah and the rituals of Hajj and Umrah, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace be upon him) specified places before reaching Makkah, where pilgrims enter into the state of Ihram, and from which they begin reciting their Talbiyah before reaching the Haram.

After specifying the exact locations of these places, the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) said: "These Miqats are for the people at those very places and those who come through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and Umrah".

These sites differ in their distance from and proximity to the Grand Mosque, depending on which direction you come from.

Pilgrims who live beyond those Miqats are obliged to enter into Ihram at the Miqats or any adjacent or parallel points on the way, whether they travel by air or by land. They should not go beyond them without entering the state of Ihram.

            <strong>Determining your Miqats</strong>
              </p>
              <p> 
              The reason why Miqats are prescribed is to venerate the Grand Mosque of Makkah. Miqats depend on the whereabouts of the person who intends to perform Hajj or Umrah; i.e., whether they are in Makkah, somewhere between Makkah and the Miqat, or beyond the Miqat. All of that would be explained as follows:</p>
               <ul class="kexixH"> 
 <strong > Those who are in Makkah:</strong> 
              
              
              <li>
They enter into the state of Ihram for Umrah from the nearest place outside the Haram, such as Masjid Aisha in Al Taneem. As for Hajj, pilgrims shall enter into the state of Ihram from the very place they are in.
                  </li>
              <strong> Those somewhere between Makkah and the Miqats:</strong>  
              <li>
hey enter into the state of Ihram for Hajj or Umrah from the very place they are in, like in the case of someone living in Jeddah or Bahrah.
                  </li>
           
                            <strong> Those somewhere between Makkah and the Miqats: </strong>  
              <li>
They shall enter into the state of Ihram for Hajj or Umrah from one of the five Miqats or from a parallel point.
                  </li>
              A pilgrim or a visitor living far from Makkah is obliged to enter the state of Ihram at one of these five Miqats or a parallel point on their way regardless of the travel means, by a plane or by a vehicle. They may not go beyond the Miqat without entering the state of Ihram.
              </ul> 
              
              
              <p><strong> Miqats for Ihram</strong></p>

Miqats are the places from which a pilgrim who wants to perform Hajj or Umrah enters into Ihram. A pilgrim seeking to perform Hajj or Umrah must not pass from one of these Miqats without entering the state of ihram. They are:
              
              
           
            <ul class="kexixH">
